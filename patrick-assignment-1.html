            <p>Patented Technology</p>
            <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit
                strong
                neural phase locking- allowing populationsof neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated avtivity-
                and
                technology to remove distraction in sound.</p>
            <p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you in a desired mental state.In other words, we've
                found
                new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

            <p>Tested on Brain and Behavior</p>
            <p>Scientist at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to
                run experiments.</p>
            <p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and
                EEG, and also run large-scale behavorial tests measuring performance on simple games</p>
            <p>Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo') of the
                same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can make sure our tech is what
                makes the difference.</p>
