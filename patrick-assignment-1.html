                technology to elicit strong neural<br>
                phase locking- allowing populationsof neurons to engage in<br>
                various kinds of coordinated avtivity- and technology to <br>

            <p class="bottom-1-text-3">This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you in a desired mental
                state.
                In
                other words, we've found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

                        EEG, and also run large-scale behavorial tests measuring performance on simple games</p>

                        same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can make sure our tech is what
                        makes the difference.</p>
